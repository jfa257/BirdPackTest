# BirdPackTest


Sample Project developed in C# with Unity 3D

By Jorge Fernando Acuna de Zayas. No collaborators of any kind on this project.

A simple demo of controlling a bird/character moving either randomly or orderly through 5 locations on the scene. Also can summon the bird
to the player location (the floating sphere in the middle of the pillars) at any time if press player react, and then key S. Any comments or tips,
drop an email to jfa3dwizard@gmail.com
